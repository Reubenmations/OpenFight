# Project OpenFight
a long shot at making a working angry birds fight server that can be used with Apache, open sourced here on github forever to be preserved.

Progress: Partially playable

This project is free to be used in your revivals of the game, and no credit is needed however some would be appreciated :)

If your here to play ABF, I would instead use ABF: Reboot @ https://www.starpixelproductions.com/angrybirds-fight-reboot since it's actually playable, has more working features and you don't have to create it yourself.

# How do I use this?

1. I recommend you download and setup XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org, make sure to use the download for your OS. (Example: I would use the Windows installer if on any version of windows)
