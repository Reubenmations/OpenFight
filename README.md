# Project OpenFight
a long shot at making a working angry birds fight server that can be used with Apache, open sourced here on github forever to be preserved.

Progress: Partially playable, you can get past 1-1 but other elements may be broken or unfinished

This project is free to be used in your revivals of the game, and no credit is needed however some would be appreciated :)

# How do I use this?

1. I recommend you download and setup XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org, make sure to use the download for your OS. (Example: I would use the Windows installer if on any version of windows)
